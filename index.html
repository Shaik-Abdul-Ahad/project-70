                        <p class="p_modal">A school library is a place where we can find the books we need and have a proper environment to read books with peace. A library is a place that feeds us knowledge with the help of books. Every school has a library. My school also has a library which is located on the second floor of our school building.My school library is huge; it has a total of two rooms, one room has all the shelves or cabinets to store books, and the second room has the facility to sit and read books.The library is very quiet and is very good.At the entrance of our library study room, there is a table of librarian of our school; the librarian manages the books in the library.In our library, there are many wooden cabinets and iron cabinets in which different books are present.The library room is fully air-conditioned.Our reading room is large, airy and there is a garden next to our reading room. That room is very quiet and full of peace.We also have an opportunity to issue books from the library to read them afterward at home. I use to issue 2-3 books every week from our school library. Because we know book reading is the best thing to do.We all should read books regularly to improve our knowledge. I love reading books and love my school library a lot. I spend a lot of time in the library reading books.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">A church building, church house, or simply church, is a building used for Christian worship services and other Christian religious activities. The term is used to refer to the physical buildings where Christians worship and also to refer to the community of Christians. Sometimes it is used as an analogy for the buildings of other religions.[1] In traditional Christian architecture the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross; the center aisle and seating representing the vertical beam with the bema and altar forming the horizontal. Towers or domes may inspire contemplation of the heavens. Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and layouts. Some buildings designed for other purposes have been converted to churches, while many original church buildings have been put to other uses.The earliest identified Christian church building is a house church founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries there was a wave of church construction in western Europe. A cathedral is a church building housing a cathedra, the seat or throne of a presiding bishop.According to the New Testament, the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes (Acts 17:5, 20:20, 1 Corinthians 16:19) or in Jewish places of worship, like the Second Temple or synagogues (Acts 2:46, 19:8). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a house church (domus ecclesiae), the Dura-Europos church, founded between 233 and 256.[4] In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worship (aula ecclesiae) began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the Diocletianic Persecution, even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor Constantine the Great.[5]</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.
                            It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.
                            There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are â€˜comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.
                            At the time of any function, sofas and chairs are installed on the stage, that is, dais. Chairs and benches are then also installed in the entire hall for students. Only participants, senior teachers and VIPs sit on the sofas and chairs on the dais.
                            At the time of school functions such as annual prize distribution, variety show, fancy dress show, speech-making, debates, seminars, workshops, declamation contests, quiz contests, etc. some prominent citizens are also invited.
                            Our school hall being quite spacious long is known to be a suitable place for holding such functions as inter-school contests, blood donation camps, various disease awareness campaigns such as pulse polio, tuberculosis control, leprosy control, etc. It is also sometimes used by the district administration for conferences, etc.</p>

We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.Our canteen provides all kinds of food. You would get the vegetarian food and the non-vegetarian food. You have the rice varieties which may include the normal meals or fried rice and also fast food kind of items which includes sandwiches, rolls, wraps, burgers etc.Even soft drinks and packet juices are provided. You just need to choose which food you would like to have and pay accordingly. The canteen food is very tasty and it is very neat. The food is all sealed and served in packets, so that it makes it easy to carry around and have food. There is a canteen in-charge that takes care of the quality of the food and the neatness of the canteen.The cooks of the canteen are very nice and they make sure that we students get the best food. Since the canteen functions very well, most of the students prefer to have food from here and the canteen would be full almost on all working days.Even on special occasions or get together, the canteen provides food for the students and staff participating in the occasion or get together. It is really great to have a canteen in the premises of the school and to get good and tasty food, when we want.</p>
